          <p>
            Whether your stay was impeccable and you wish to praise a hotel, or
            your visit fell into the nightmare
          </p>
          <p>
            Telling other travelers what type of room you stayed in might help
            them narrow down which hotel reviews to read based on their own room
            preferences. If you can think of any details you wish you would have
            been aware of before your stay, share them.

            Great location, really pleasant and clean rooms, but the thing that
            makes this such a good place to stay are the staff. All of the
            people are incredibly helpful and generous with their time and
            advice.This was one of the nicest places we stayed in the four weeks
            we were in Chennai.

            This hotel is great value. It is in an excellent location within
            walking distance of all the sites. The rooms are large and
            characterful furnished. Breakfasts were good. And the staff really
            could not have been more friendly and helpful.This was a best place.
